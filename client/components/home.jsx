                HO HO!  IT WORKS!!!  Ok it doesn't ALL work, but it works a lot better than my last version!
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: for some reason (that I couldn't figure out in time), the pages wont render until you refresh them.  So when you navigate to another page, you will need to hit the refresh button.
            </p>
        </div>
    )

export default Home;
